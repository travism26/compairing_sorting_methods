compairing_sorting_methods: Heap and Selection sort
===================================================

I will be coding and testing two sorting algorithms selection sort which is a straight forward sorting algorithm and heap sort which is a slightly more complicated sorting algorithm. I will test their speed and execution time in milliseconds, I was able to sort a list of 100,000,000 random values in under 1 minute (56 seconds exactly) using the heap sort. I noticed after 100,000 list size the selection sort starting taking time to process all the values.
